This project is cooperatively completed by Zerong Zheng (Tsinghua University) and me in 2016.

· Classified 6 types of images using machine learning algorithms (such as SVM, softmax, and kNN) and deep learning networks(such as ResNet-50, ResNet-152, and VggNet); analyzed their performances (max acc 80%)· Designed a novel deep learning network with additional convolutional layers

May add some notes and comments in the future.
